Continuous Integration (CI), at its core, is about getting feedback early and often, which makes it possible to identify and correct problems early in the development process. With CI, you integrate your work frequently, often multiple times a day, instead of waiting for one large integration later on. Each integration is verified with an automated build, which enables you to detect integration issues as quickly as possible and reduce problems downstream.

Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI. CD is about packaging and preparing the software with the goal of delivering incremental changes to users.  Deployment strategies such as red/black and canary deployments can help reduce release risk and increase confidence in releases. CD makes the release process safer, lower risk, faster, and, when done well, boring. Once  deployments are made painless with CD, developers can focus on writing code, not tweaking deployment scripts.
